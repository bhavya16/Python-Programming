# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.
a = 0
b = 0.0
c = ""
# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.
a = int(input())
b = float(input())
c = str(input()) 
# Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.
print(i+a)
# Print the sum of the double variables on a new line.
print(d+b)
# Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line
print(s+c)
